# Final-Project --> Battery Health Prediction for Preventive Maintenance 🚗🔋

Overview
This project predicts battery health using machine learning to enable preventive maintenance. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using regression techniques. The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input battery parameters and get real-time predictions.

📌 Features
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data visualization, correlation analysis, and outlier detection
✔️ Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling
✔️ Machine Learning Model: Trained regression models to predict battery degradation
✔️ Model Evaluation: Metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score
✔️ Streamlit Deployment: Web app for real-time predictions
